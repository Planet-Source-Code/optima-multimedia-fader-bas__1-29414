'This is the first Fader.Bas that I have seen, that does this.

'The PulseBackFade will fade any Object
'including(Forms,Labels,Buttons,Pictureboxes, any Object
'in VB that has a BackColor property.
'The PulseForeFade will fade any Object
'including(Forms,Labels,Buttons,Pictureboxes, any Object
'in VB that has a ForeColor property.
'The PulseFades fade your Objects from one color to another
'and then back again.

'Example of use:
'PulseBackFade 255,0,34,134,234,23,Label1,0.3,10
' THe first 3 numbers are your first color in RGB value. Red From 0-255,
'Green from 0-255,Blue from 0-255. The next 3 numbers are your second color.
'Then you have the object you want to fade.
'Then you set the Fade speed
'Then you set how much you want the color to change with each loop.
'For example: Setting Step to 1 will provide a much smoother fade then
'setting Step to 40. This also effects the speed of the fade.

'To see the Color Values in the 3 labels Uncomment the Lines in the Subs
